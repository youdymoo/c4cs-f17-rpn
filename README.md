A simple Python implementation of RPN calculator wich supports addition, subraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.

> .travis.yml

To make the RPN calculatior passes the online test of Travis, I add the ``.travis.yml`` into the whole repository. Using Travis CI as the CI platform, I pass the linter tool that checks code for syntax and style problems. The test on Travis CI is https://travis-ci.org/youdymoo/c4cs-f17-rpn.
